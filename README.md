# ValidArgumentChecker
Checks first-order symbolic logical arguments for validity via the command line.

## Instructions
Type a logical argument or expression at the prompt and press ENTER. The argument will be evaluated for logical validity (i.e. tautology via a truth table) and the result will be printed to the console.

## Syntax
` a-Z` - propositions
` ( )` - parentheses
`  ~ ` - not
`  & ` - and
`  | ` - or
`  > ` - if-then
`  = ` - if and only if

## Notes
 - Operator precedence is as shown above.
 - Spaces can be used freely to improve readability.
